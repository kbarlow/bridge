# ðŸ§­ Bridge Manifesto

## Why We Exist

Bridge is a language for humans and machines to meet in the middle.

As data systems grow more complex and AI agents more capable, we believe there's a need for a shared interface â€” a medium where business intent, machine logic, and human understanding align.

Bridge isn't about replacing SQL or making things "easier." It's about expressing intent clearly, semantically, and collaboratively â€” in a way that:
- Humans can read and write confidently
- Machines can interpret and execute reliably
- Teams can evolve together

## Our Principles

### 1. Meaning First
We care about *what* you're trying to say, not just *how* you say it. Semantics before syntax.

### 2. Decouple Logic from Structure
Business rules and logic shouldn't be trapped in fragile SQL strings. They should live at a higher layer â€” versioned, validated, and reusable.

### 3. Make the Invisible Visible
Bridge makes assumptions explicit. Terms like `good_customer` or `net_deposits` carry deep meaning â€” and we make that meaning visible and shared.

### 4. Grow Through Collaboration
The language is meant to evolve â€” through real-world use, feedback, and human-AI cooperation. Itâ€™s not a static spec, but a living dialogue.

### 5. Respect Both Sides
We respect the strengths of human judgment *and* machine precision. Bridge is not here to replace either â€” but to enhance both.

## A Language Between Worlds

As AI systems become more fluent in human language, and humans more fluent in data, Bridge offers a place to meet in the middle.
