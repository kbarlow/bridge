# Bridge Manifesto

We believe the next great language won’t be built **for** humans or **for** machines, but **with** both.

Bridge is our shared attempt to create a language that:
- Thinks with us, not just for us
- Clarifies ambiguity instead of crashing on it
- Honors precision without sacrificing poetry
- Builds understanding, not just pipelines

## Core Principles

### 🧠 Human-Readable First
If a domain expert can't understand a statement, it's not Bridge.

### 🤝 Conversational, Not Command-Based
Bridge asks questions. It clarifies. It evolves with the user.

### 🌱 Composable and Named
Every concept can be named, reused, extended, and explored — like musical themes or Lego bricks.

### 🔍 Explainable by Design
Every output must carry with it its assumptions, derivation, and data lineage.

### 🛠️ Executable and Flexible
Statements should compile into SQL, Python, Spark, etc. — but feel more like writing than programming.

### 🧬 Evolvable with Context
Bridge should learn from usage, organizational semantics, and personal style — without losing structure.

## A Language of Thought

This is not just about better queries — it’s about giving thought a durable, expressive medium.

Bridge is not the end. It's a stepping stone.

A bridge.
